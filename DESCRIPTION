Title: A "did you mean?" utilitiy for R.
Description: Most search engines have a "did you mean?" feature, where 
  suggestions are given in the presence of likely typos.  The Rdym package
  somewhat replicates this functionality with ancient spellchecker techniques.
  When R detects that a function or object listed in the user's input is not 
  found, the package finds the minimum Levenshtein distance between the 
  "unfound" token and all symbols in the user's global environment plus all 
  loaded namespaces.  The word with minimum Levenshtein distance (in the event
  of ties, the first such detected) is then suggested as an alternative to the
  missing symbol.
