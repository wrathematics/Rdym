Title: A "Did You Mean?" Utility for R
Description: Most search engines have a "did you mean?" feature, where
    suggestions are given in the presence of likely typos. We are able to
    somewhat replicate this functionality with ancient spellchecker techniques.
    When R detects that a function or object listed in the user's input is not
    found, the package finds the minimum 'Levenshtein' distance between the
    "'un-found'" token and all symbols in the user's global environment plus all
    loaded 'namespaces'.  The word with minimum 'Levenshtein' distance (in the event
    of ties, the first such detected) is then suggested as an alternative to the
    missing symbol.  To use, simply load the package from an interactive R
    session and start making some errors.  However, there is an explicit
    interface for starting and stopping "did you mean?" behavior.
